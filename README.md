## QUADRATIC FUNCTION 
> A quadratic function takes the form of f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c, where 'a','b','c' are elements of Real Numbers
> and 'a' is not equal to zero.
> 
###BUILT WITH:
> This program was implemented using Java.
> 
###ABOUT THIS PROJECT
>- It evaluates the function and returns the value of the function at x.
>- It also gets the extreme point of a function represented by (-b/2a).
>- It also shows the result of the function along an upward vertical shift.
>- It also shows the result of the function along a horizontal shift to the right.
>- Finally, a *toString()* method to return a string representation in the form of a*x^2 + bx + c.
